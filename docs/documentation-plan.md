# Documentation Audit Summary

This repository provides a C reflection library that relies on preprocessed recipes to generate metadata-rich wrappers around structs, unions, and enums. The current documentation covers the high-level pitch and a single JSON example, but it misses several critical explanations needed for new users or contributors. The sections below capture the key documentation gaps and recommended deliverables.

## 1. High-Level Overview & Motivation

- **Missing content:** Rationale for the project, real-world use-cases (e.g., serialization, schema validation, UI binding) and comparison to manual reflection tables.
- **Action:** Add an "Overview" section explaining how the library works conceptually and what problems it solves.

## 2. Build & Tooling Workflow

- **Missing content:** Step-by-step instructions for the code generation toolchain (how `.PRE.h` recipe files are expanded, required macros, and the role of `reflect-c_EXPAND_COMMENTS`).
- **Action:** Document the build pipeline, including how to run the provided `Makefile`, the meaning of `REFLECTC_DEFINITIONS`, `REFLECTC_WRAPPER`, `REFLECTC_HEADER`, and how generated files (`reflect-c_GENERATED.{c,h}`) are produced.

## 3. Anatomy of Recipe Files

- **Missing content:** Detailed explanation of the `PUBLIC` / `PRIVATE` macros, tuple syntax, qualifiers, decorators, array dimensions, and enum entries.
- **Action:** Provide a dedicated section that breaks down recipe syntax with tables and annotated examples, highlighting supported type categories and constraints.

## 4. Generated API Reference

- **Missing content:** Comprehensive reference for generated helpers (e.g., `reflectc_from_<type>`, lookup enums, fast access macros) and how they relate to the runtime API in `reflect-c.h`.
- **Action:** Produce an API table covering purpose, parameters, ownership, and lifetime expectations for each symbol.

## 5. Runtime Utility Functions

- **Missing content:** Behavioral description and edge cases for runtime helpers such as `reflectc_length`, `reflectc_get_pos`, `reflectc_get_member`, `reflectc_get_pointer_depth`, `reflectc_deref`, `reflectc_set`, and `reflectc_string`.
- **Action:** Add docstrings or README subsections that clarify pointer depth semantics, array handling, mutability guarantees, and error conditions.

## 6. Memory Management & Safety Considerations

- **Missing content:** Guidance on allocation strategies, ownership of generated `struct reflectc` instances, and cleanup expectations (`reflectc_free` helpers do not exist—users must call `free`).
- **Action:** Describe lifecycle patterns, including when callers must free reflection trees or allocate buffers for strings.

## 7. Examples & Tutorials

- **Missing content:** Progressive examples beyond the JSON demo—e.g., iterating over members, editing nested structures, handling union types, working with arrays, and integrating with other libraries.
- **Action:** Create an "Examples" section with runnable snippets and scripts under `examples/` or inline in the README, covering both serialization and mutation workflows.

## 8. Testing & Validation Instructions

- **Missing content:** Directions for running the test suite (`make test` under `test/`), interpreting results, and adding new tests.
- **Action:** Document test dependencies and how to run them from the project root.

## 9. Configuration & Extensibility

- **Missing content:** Explanation of optional `#define`s like `REFLECTC_PUBLIC`, `REFLECTC_PRIVATE`, `REFLECTC_HEADER`, `REFLECTC_FORWARD`, and support for custom `reflectc_from_cb` callbacks.
- **Action:** Add a section describing how to extend the generator to hook custom behaviors or integrate additional metadata.

## 10. Limitations & Compatibility

- **Missing content:** Current limitations (e.g., lack of automatic struct freeing, handling of bitfields, variadic arrays) and compiler support guarantees (C89 / ANSI C).
- **Action:** Provide a "Limitations & FAQ" section covering unsupported features and future enhancements.

## Deliverables

1. **Revamped README:** A comprehensive README that incorporates the items above in a digestible order.
2. **Supplemental Reference Docs:** Optionally populate `docs/` with deeper specifications (e.g., `docs/recipe-format.md`, `docs/runtime-api.md`) if the README becomes too large.
3. **Example Programs:** Add a small `examples/` directory or extend the test harness with runnable demos referenced in the documentation.

This plan should guide the documentation refresh and ensure new contributors can understand, build, and extend the library with confidence.
